Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know that:

The BERT model’s job is to predict which sentence is the appropriate continuation.

BERT’s architecture allows fine-tuning tasks like text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis.

For data preparation, you should initialize a tokenizer using "get_tokenizer" and define special symbols with their corresponding indices.
