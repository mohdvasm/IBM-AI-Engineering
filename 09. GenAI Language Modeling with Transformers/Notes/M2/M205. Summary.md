Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know that:

The decoder is pivotal in text generation and is the foundation for GPT, LLaMA, and Granite. It functions autoregressively when forecasting future words.

The decoderâ€™s operation diverges from the inference phases during the training phase.

Retaining context while classifying text is possible by integrating transformer attention layers.

PyTorch implementation models are similar to Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT).
