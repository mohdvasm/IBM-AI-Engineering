    "In this lab, you will explore how to leverage the Hugging Face `transformers` library for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. You will start by performing text classification and text generation using pretrained models like DistilBERT and GPT-2 without using the `pipeline()` function, understanding the steps involved in loading models, tokenizing input, performing inference, and processing outputs. Then, you will discover the simplicity and efficiency of using the `pipeline()` function to accomplish the same tasks with minimal code. By comparing both approaches, you will appreciate how the `pipeline()` function streamlines the process, making it easier and faster to implement NLP solutions.\n"

    "### **Understanding `softmax(dim=-1)` Step by Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have this matrix (a **2D tensor**) with **3 rows and 4 columns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "logits = [\n",
    "  [0.5291, 0.1945, 0.0887, 0.1877],\n",
    "  [0.1005, 0.6245, 0.1715, 0.1035],\n",
    "  [0.2503, 0.4760, 0.0901, 0.1836]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: What is `dim=-1`?**\n",
    "- **`dim=-1` means \"apply softmax to the last dimension\".**  \n",
    "- In a **2D matrix**, the last dimension (or axis) is the **columns**.\n",
    "- So, **softmax is applied separately to each row** (not columns).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: How Does It Work?**\n",
    "Softmax converts numbers into **probabilities** by making sure each row **sums to 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Let's apply softmax row by row:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "For **Row 1** → `[0.5291, 0.1945, 0.0887, 0.1877]`  \n",
    "- Softmax takes these **four numbers** and transforms them into **four probabilities**.  \n",
    "- The sum of these **four probabilities** will be **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Row 2** → `[0.1005, 0.6245, 0.1715, 0.1035]`  \n",
    "- Again, softmax applies only to these **four values**, making sure they sum to **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Row 3** → `[0.2503, 0.4760, 0.0901, 0.1836]`  \n",
    "- The same process happens: softmax turns these four numbers into **four probabilities** that sum to **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Why Do We Apply Softmax Like This?**\n",
    "- In **machine learning (ML)**, especially in classification tasks, each row represents a **different sample**.\n",
    "- Each **column** represents a different **class**.\n",
    "- Softmax ensures that for each row (each sample), the numbers **turn into probabilities** that add up to **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **So, using `softmax(dim=-1)` means:**\n",
    "- \"Apply softmax across columns, treating each row separately.\"\n",
    "- \"Make each row sum to **1**, so we get valid probability values.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visual Example**\n",
    "Imagine each row is a different student taking a test, and each column represents a different subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Student | Math | Science | History | English |\n",
    "|---------|------|---------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **A**  | 0.5  | 0.2     | 0.1     | 0.2     |\n",
    "| **B**  | 0.1  | 0.6     | 0.2     | 0.1     |\n",
    "| **C**  | 0.2  | 0.5     | 0.1     | 0.2     |\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax ensures that **each student's row sums to 1**, making it a **valid probability distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Happens If We Use `dim=0` Instead?**\n",
    "- `dim=0` means **apply softmax across rows (column-wise).**\n",
    "- This would mean comparing **Math scores across all students**, then **Science scores across all students**, etc.\n",
    "- This is usually **not** what we want in classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways for Beginners**\n",
    "✅ **`dim=-1` applies softmax row-wise (across columns)**.  \n",
    "✅ **Each row is treated separately, and softmax converts values into probabilities that sum to 1**.  \n",
    "✅ **This is useful in ML because each row represents a different sample's class probabilities**.  \n"
