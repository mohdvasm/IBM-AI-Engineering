Using Pre-Trained Transformers and Fine-Tuning

Welcome to Using Pre-Trained Transformers and Fine-Tuning. After watching this video, you'll be able to review the uses of pre-trained transformer models, describe fine-tuning and why it's necessary, and explain the different approaches to fine-tuning. Transformer models like BERT, Llama, and GPT have revolutionized natural language processing or NLP with their attention-based architecture and ability to be pre-trained on large unlabeled text datasets. The pre-training process allows these models to learn rich representations of language that can then be leveraged for a wide range of downstream NLP tasks. Training large language models or LLMs with billions of parameters is computationally expensive, requiring powerful hardware like graphics processing units or GPU's, and substantial training data. The process is time consuming, taking weeks or months, and involves complex optimization over multiple epochs. Setting up and maintaining the necessary infrastructure adds additional costs. Overall, training LLMs demand significant computational resources, time, and investment. Fine-tuning LLMs adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains using domain-specific data. This process adjusts the model's parameters to improve task performance, leveraging pre-existing language understanding. Fine-tuning enhances efficiency and saves time and computational resources compared to training models from scratch. Let's look at some benefits of fine-tuning. Fine-tuning LLMs is valuable in transfer learning, especially with limited labeled data availability, providing time and resource efficiency by bypassing initial training stages and achieving faster conversions. Fine-tuning allows you to tailor the model's responses to align with your specific requirements, ensuring that it produces accurate and contextually relevant outputs. This task-specific adaptation is crucial for applications like sentiment analysis or text generation within diverse domains. To avoid pitfalls in fine-tuning LLMs, you should consider the following: Overfitting: to prevent the model from performing well only on training data, you should avoid using a small dataset or extending training epochs excessively. Underfitting: you must ensure sufficient training and an appropriate learning rate to enable adequate learning. Catastrophic forgetting: prevent the model from losing its initial broad knowledge, which can hinder performance on various NLP tasks. Data leakage: keep training and validation datasets separate to avoid misleading metrics. Addressing these issues can optimize fine-tuning for better performance and generalization on specific tasks or domains. Fine-tuning causal decoder models can appear straightforward by creating a dataset specific to the task. For example, a question-answering bot designed to answer questions about cars can be retrained with a dataset about cars. However, in practice, these methods require novel cost functions such as reinforcement learning, direct preference optimization, and training encoder models to evaluate the model. Scoring large language models, that is, response evaluation can be challenging. Humans excel at comparing two responses, but often struggle with assigning absolute scores. For instance, given two responses to the question, which country owns Antarctica? One might say, Antarctica is governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which is accurate and informative, while another might quip, Our penguin overlords run the show down there, which is humorous but incorrect. While it's easy for humans to identify the first response as good and the second as bad, quantifying these judgments numerically is more complex. This can be addressed by fine-tuning an LLM such as BERT that understands language to produce a single output analogous more to regression than classification using reward modeling. As you can see here, the first response scores better than the second. There are three main approaches to fine-tuning language models. Number one is self supervised fine-tuning. Here, the model learns to predict missing words in a large unlabeled dataset such as next words or masked words. Number two is supervised fine-tuning, where the model is fine-tuned using labeled data from the target task, improving its performance on specific tasks like sentiment classification. Number three is reinforcement learning from human feedback or RLHF. In this technique, the model is adjusted based on explicit feedback from human annotators aligning its outputs with human preferences. These methods enable language models to adapt to specific tasks or domains, leveraging self-supervised learning, supervised learning, or human feedback. Hybrid fine-tuning combining multiple techniques can further enhance model performance. Chat GPT, developed by OpenAI, is an example that utilizes such hybrid methods. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is an emerging popular approach that focuses on optimizing language models directly based on human preferences. Let's look at some of its features. First is its simplicity. DPO can be more straightforward to implement than RL. Due to its human-centric optimization, DPO explicitly focuses on aligning model outputs with human preferences and judgments. DPO requires no reward training, that is, there's no need to train an additional reward model. Finally, DPO can achieve faster convergence due to its reliance on direct feedback. Let's look at how supervised fine-tuning can be done. There are two different ways. First is full fine-tuning, where all the parameters of the model are tuned for the specific task. The second is a more efficient way of fine-tuning foundation models called parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). In this methodology, large pre-trained models can be fine-tuned without modifying most of their original parameters. Let's now recap what you've learned. In this video, you learned that training large language models or LLMs with billions of parameters is computationally expensive, requiring powerful hardware like graphics processing units or GPOs and substantial training data. Fine-tuning LLMs adapts pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains using domain-specific data. Fine-tuning enhances efficiency and saves time and computational resources compared to training models from scratch. Benefits of fine-tuning include transfer learning, time and resource efficiency, tailored responses, and task-specific adaptation. Addressing issues like overfitting, underfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and data leakage can optimize fine-tuning for better performance and generalization on specific domains. Three main approaches to fine-tuning language models include self-supervised fine-tuning, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Direct preference optimization (DPO) is an emerging popular approach that focuses on optimizing language models directly based on human preferences. Supervised fine-tuning can be done in two different ways, full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
