You have a reward function trained on the sentiment classifier from the IMDb dataset, and you will now use Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a subfield of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. The agent, in this case, will be the LLM, and the decisions will be about what text to output. Unlike supervised learning, which requires labeled input/output pairs, RL relies on the agent exploring the environment and learning from the feedback it receives in the form of rewards or penalties. This trial-and-error approach enables the agent to improve its decision-making strategy over time.\n","\n","Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is one of the most effective and widely used RL algorithms. Introduced by OpenAI, PPO strikes a balance between simplicity and performance, making it a popular choice for training RL agents. PPO optimizes the policy directly and employs mechanisms to ensure the updates are not too drastic, thereby maintaining stability and reliability during training.\n","\n","In this lab, you will be guided through the process of training an RL agent using the PPO algorithm with a focus on sentiment analysis. You will use the IMDb dataset, a large collection of movie reviews, to train your model. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement and train an RL agent using PPO, and you will be equipped with practical skills to apply RL techniques to other problems and datasets.\n","This lab is based on [a HF example code titled `Tune GPT2 to generate positive reviews`](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/examples/notebooks/gpt2-sentiment.ipynb).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7e7e4c33-7c4e-4331-96a2-af0537d3cb08","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["##
