In this lab, let's use the [BLEU score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU), a metric originally intended to check the quality of translations made by translation models. You can calculate the BLEU scores for individual generated segments by comparing them with a set of expected outputs and average the scores for the individual segments. Depending on the implementation, BLEU scores range from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100 (as in the implementation used herein), with higher scores indicating a better match between the model generated output and the expected output.\n","\n","_**Note:**_ \n","1. The BLEU score was originally implemented for assessing the quality of translations. However, it may not necessarily be the best metric for instruction fine-tuning in general, but it is nonetheless a useful metric that gives a sense of the alignment between the model generated output and the expected output.\n","2. BLEU scores are very challenging to compare from one study to the next because it is a parametrized metric. As a result, you can employ a variant of BLEU called [SacreBLEU](https://aclanthology.org/W18-6319/) invariant to the metric's parametrization.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"7bd826da-75fb-4933-9af4-db660685e686","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["sacrebleu = evaluate.load(\"sacrebleu\")\nresults_base = sacrebleu.compute(predictions=generated_outputs_base,\n                                 references=expected_outputs)\n\nprint(list(results_base.keys()))\nprint(round(results_base[\"score\"], 1))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"80e71f4e-b6c6-44df-ac53-b7e751de08c3","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["The SacreBLEU score of 0.4/100 indicates that there is very little alignment between the base model's generated responses and the expected responses for the examples in the test dataset.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"70c64d11-a483-4879-a2ed-759ce8d14b1a","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4b61833f-d2d7-481f-a6cb-f777f6358f44","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Perform instruction fine-tuning with LoRA\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c617b20e-7eb4-406c-992b-22eef42957cc","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["To save time, let's perform instruction fine-tuning using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method called low-rank adaptation (LoRA).\n","First, convert the model into a PEFT model suitable for LoRA fine-tuning by defining a `LoraConfig` object from the `peft` library that outlines LoRA parameters, such as the LoRA rank and the target modules.
