# Load Documents Using LangChain for Different Sources 


Estimated time needed: **20** minutes


Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a consulting firm, and you've been tasked with analyzing documents from multiple clients. Each client provides their data in different formats: some in PDFs, others in Word documents, CSV files, or even HTML webpages. Manually loading and parsing each document type is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. Your goal is to streamline this process, making it efficient and error-free.

To achieve this, you'll use LangChainâ€™s powerful document loaders. These loaders allow you to read and convert various file formats into a unified document structure that can be easily processed. For example, you'll load client policy documents from text files, financial reports from PDFs, marketing strategies from Word documents, and product reviews from JSON files. By the end of this lab, you will have a robust pipeline that can handle any new file formats clients might send, saving you valuable time and effort.

In this lab, you will explore how to use various loaders provided by LangChain to load and process data from different file formats. These loaders simplify the task of reading and converting files into a document format that can be processed downstream. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently load text, PDF, Markdown, JSON, CSV, DOCX, and other file formats into a unified format, allowing for seamless data analysis and manipulation for LLM applications.

(Note: In this lab, we just introduced several commonly used file format loaders. LangChain provides more document loaders for various document formats [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders/).)

## Setup


### Installing required libraries

The following required libraries are __not__ preinstalled in the Skills Network Labs environment. __You must run the following cell__ to install them:

**Note:** We are pinning the version here to specify the version. It's recommended that you do this as well. Even if the library is updated in the future, the installed library could still support this lab work.

This might take approximately 1 minute. 

As we use `%%capture` to capture the installation, you won't see the output process. But after the installation completes, you will see a number beside the cell.



```python

%%capture
#After executing the cell,please RESTART the kernel and run all the cells.
!pip install --user "langchain-community==0.2.1"
!pip install --user "pypdf==4.2.0"
!pip install --user "PyMuPDF==1.24.5"
!pip install --user "unstructured==0.14.8"
!pip install --user "markdown==3.6"
!pip install --user  "jq==1.7.0"
!pip install --user "pandas==2.2.2"
!pip install --user "docx2txt==0.8"
!pip install --user "requests==2.32.3"
!pip install --user "beautifulsoup4==4.12.3"
!pip install --user "nltk==3.8.0"

```

After you install the libraries, restart your kernel. You can do that by clicking the **Restart the kernel** icon.

### Importing Required Libraries

_We recommend you import all required libraries in one place (here):_



```python
# You can also use this section to suppress warnings generated by your code:

def warn(*args, **kwargs):
    pass
import warnings
warnings.warn = warn
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

from pprint import pprint
import json
from pathlib import Path
import nltk
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyMuPDFLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredMarkdownLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders import JSONLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import UnstructuredCSVLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders import Docx2txtLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredFileLoader

nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng')
```

### Load from TXT files


The `TextLoader` is a tool designed to load textual data from various sources.

It is the simplest loader, reading a file as text and placing all the content into a single document.


We have prepared a .txt file for you to load. First, we need to download it from a remote source.


We have prepared a .txt file for you to load. First, we need to download it from a remote source.



```python
!wget "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/Ec5f3KYU1CpbKRp1whFLZw/new-Policies.txt"
```

Next, we will use the `TextLoader` class to load the file.



```python
loader = TextLoader("new-Policies.txt")
loader
```

Here, we use the `load` method to load the data as documents.



```python
data = loader.load()
```

Let's present the entire data (document) here.

This is a `document` object that includes `page_content` and `metadata` attributes.



```python
data
```

We can also use the `pprint` function to print the first 1000 characters of the `page_content` here.



```python
pprint(data[0].page_content[:1000])
```

### Load from PDF files


Sometimes, we may have files in PDF format that we want to load for processing.

LangChain provides several classes for loading PDFs. Here, we introduce two classes: `PyPDFLoader` and `PyMuPDFLoader`.


#### PyPDFLoader


Load the PDF using `PyPDFLoader` into an array of documents, where each document contains the page content and metadata with the page number.



```python
pdf_url = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/Q81D33CdRLK6LswuQrANQQ/instructlab.pdf"

loader = PyPDFLoader(pdf_url)

pages = loader.load_and_split()
```

Display the first page of the PDF.



```python
print(pages[0])
```

Display the first three pages of the PDF.



```python
for p,page in enumerate(pages[0:3]):
    print(f"page number {p+1}")
    print(page)
```

#### PyMuPDFLoader


`PyMuPDFLoader` is the fastest of the PDF parsing options. It provides detailed metadata about the PDF and its pages, and returns one document per page.



```python
loader = PyMuPDFLoader(pdf_url)
loader
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
print(data[0])
```

The `metadata` attribute reveals that `PyMuPDFLoader` provides more detailed metadata information than `PyPDFLoader`.


### Load from Markdown files


Sometimes, our file source might be in Markdown format.

LangChain provides the `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader` to load content from Markdown files.



```python
!wget 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/eMSP5vJjj9yOfAacLZRWsg/markdown-sample.md'
```


```python
markdown_path = "markdown-sample.md"
loader = UnstructuredMarkdownLoader(markdown_path)
loader
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data
```

### Load from JSON files



The JSONLoader uses a specified [jq schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jq_(programming_language)) to parse the JSON files. It uses the jq python package, which we've installed before.



```python
!wget 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/hAmzVJeOUAMHzmhUHNdAUg/facebook-chat.json'
```

First, let's use `pprint` to take a look at the JSON file and its structure. 



```python
file_path='facebook-chat.json'
data = json.loads(Path(file_path).read_text())
```


```python
pprint(data)
```

We use `JSONLoader` to load data from the JSON file. However, JSON files can have various attribute-value pairs. If we want to load a specific attribute and its value, we need to set an appropriate `jq schema`.

So for example, if we want to load the `content` from the JSON file, we need to set `jq_schema='.messages[].content'`.



```python
loader = JSONLoader(
    file_path=file_path,
    jq_schema='.messages[].content',
    text_content=False)

data = loader.load()
```


```python
pprint(data)
```

### Load from CSV files


CSV files are a common format for storing tabular data. The `CSVLoader` provides a convenient way to read and process this data.



```python
!wget 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IygVG_j0M87BM4Z0zFsBMA/mlb-teams-2012.csv'
```


```python
loader = CSVLoader(file_path='mlb-teams-2012.csv')
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data
```

When you load data from a CSV file, the loader typically creates a separate `Document` object for each row of data in the CSV.


#### UnstructuredCSVLoader


In contrast to `CSVLoader`, which treats each row as an individual document with headers defining the data, `UnstructuredCSVLoader` considers the entire CSV file as a single unstructured table element. This approach is beneficial when you want to analyze the data as a complete table rather than as separate entries.



```python
loader = UnstructuredCSVLoader(
    file_path="mlb-teams-2012.csv", mode="elements"
)
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data[0].page_content
```


```python
print(data[0].metadata["text_as_html"])
```

### Load from URL/Website files


Usually we use `BeautifulSoup` package to load and parse a HTML or XML file. But it has some limitations.

The following code is using `BeautifulSoup` to parse a website. Let's see what limitation it has.



```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://www.ibm.com/topics/langchain'
response = requests.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())
```

From the print output, we can see that `BeautifulSoup` not only load the web content, but also a lot of HTML tags and external links, which are not necessary if we just want to load the text content of the web.


So LangChain's `WebBaseLoader` can effectively address this limitation.

`WebBaseLoader` is designed to extract all text from HTML webpages and convert it into a document format suitable for further processing.


#### Load from single web page



```python
loader = WebBaseLoader("https://www.ibm.com/topics/langchain")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data
```

#### Load from multiple web pages


You can load multiple webpages simultaneously by passing a list of URLs to the loader. This will return a list of documents corresponding to the order of the URLs provided.



```python
loader = WebBaseLoader(["https://www.ibm.com/topics/langchain", "https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/ai/what-is-instructlab"])
data = loader.load()
data
```

### Load from WORD files


`Docx2txtLoader` is utilized to convert Word documents into a document format suitable for further processing.



```python
!wget "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/94hiHUNLZdb0bLMkrCh79g/file-sample.docx"
```


```python
loader = Docx2txtLoader("file-sample.docx")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data
```

### Load from Unstructured Files


Sometimes, we need to load content from various text sources and formats without writing a separate loader for each one. Additionally, when a new file format emerges, we want to save time by not having to write a new loader for it. `UnstructuredFileLoader` addresses this need by supporting the loading of multiple file types. Currently, `UnstructuredFileLoader` can handle text files, PowerPoints, HTML, PDFs, images, and more.


For example, we can load `.txt` file.



```python
loader = UnstructuredFileLoader("new-Policies.txt")
data = loader.load()
data
```

We also can load `.md` file.



```python
loader = UnstructuredFileLoader("markdown-sample.md")
data = loader.load()
data
```

#### Multiple files with different formats


We can even load a list of files with different formats.



```python
files = ["markdown-sample.md", "new-Policies.txt"]
```


```python
loader = UnstructuredFileLoader(files)
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data
```

<details>
    <summary>Click here for Solution</summary>
    
```python

!pip install arxiv

from langchain_community.document_loaders import ArxivLoader
