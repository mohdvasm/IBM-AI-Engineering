Congratulations and Next Steps

Congratulations on completing this course! We hope you enjoyed it. 

In this course, you had the opportunity to apply your acquired knowledge and skills to a capstone project. You learned about document loaders from LangChain and text-splitting strategies to enhance model responsiveness.

You used watsonx to embed documents, a vector database to store document embeddings, and LangChain to develop a retriever to fetch documents. Further, you implemented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve retrieval, created a QA bot, and set up a simple Gradio interface. Finally, you constructed a QA bot to answer questions from loaded documents.

This concludes the Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain course, but it is certainly not the end of the journey for learning about AI.
Next Steps

 This course is part of the Generative AI Engineering with LLMs Specialization

, which provides learners with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills to optimize the power of generative AI. Learners gain an understanding of concepts, models, and tools and learn how to apply them effectively to enhance their work and output. This specialization helps learners enhance their professional prospects and equips them with sought-after skills for career opportunities in different sectors.
